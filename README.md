# DeepSA: A Deep-learning Driven Predictor of Compound Synthesis Accessibility

With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, more and more deep-generation models are used for molecule generation. However, most new molecules generated by the generation models often face great challenges in terms of synthetic accessibility. 

DeepSA based on a chemical language model is proposed to predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds. DeepSA offers significant advantages over the state-of-arts methods and has a much higher early enrichment rate in discriminating molecules that are difficult to synthesize. This helps users to select less expensive molecules for synthesis, thus reducing the time for drug discovery and development.

You can use DeepSA on a webserver at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa<br/>

## Requirements

- Python == 3.X.X
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.14.0
- scikit-learn == 0.24.0
- pandas ==  1.1.5
- numpy == 1.19.5
- matplotlib == 3.3.4


Dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
conda create -n DeepSA python=3.X.X
conda activate DeepSA

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- CUDA == 10.0 (This is just a suggestion to make sure your program works properly)
- how to install CUDA and cuDNN:
```
conda install cudatoolkit=10.0   
conda install cudnn=7.6.5
```

## Usage For Researchers

You can run it from the command line

running:
```
    cd ./DeepSA
    python DeepSA.py
```

## Online Server

We deployed a pre-trained model on a dedicated server, which is publicly available at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa, to make it easy for biomedical researcher users to utilize DeepSA in their research activity. 

Users can upload their SMILES or csv files to the server, and then they can quickly obtain the predicted results.
