# DeepSA: A novel Prediction of Compound Synthesis Accessibility Based on Deep Learning

With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, an increasing number of deep generation models are used for molecular generation tasks. However, most of the new molecules generated by the generation models often face great challenges in terms of synthetic accessibility. In this study, a deep learning model developed based on chemical language backbones named DeepSA is proposed to access the synthesis of compounds. DeepSA offers significant advantages over previously reported techniques, and has significantly higher preconcentration rate on identifying HS molecules, helping scientific researchers to select more suitable molecules for chemical synthesis and help shorten the time for drug research and development.

## Requirements

- Python == 3.X.X
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.14.0
- scikit-learn == 0.24.0
- pandas ==  1.1.5
- numpy == 1.19.5
- matplotlib == 3.3.4


Dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
conda create -n DeepSA python=3.X.X
conda activate DeepSA

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- CUDA == 10.0 (This is just a suggestion to make sure your program works properly)
- how to install CUDA and cuDNN:
```
conda install cudatoolkit=10.0   
conda install cudnn=7.6.5
```

## Usage For Researchers

You can run it from the command line

running:
```
    cd ./DeepSA
    python DeepSA.py
```

## Online Server

We deployed a pre-trained model on a dedicated server, which is publicly available at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa, to make it easy for biomedical researcher users to utilize DeepSA in their research activity. 

Users can upload their SMILES or csv files to the server, and then they can quickly obtain the predicted results.
